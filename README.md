# Project-Lombok
Why Project Lombok come into picture? Here I'll share you everything what you can do with project lombok. There has a bad reputation in Java. We need a huge boilerplate code to develop a simple Java based project. But Lombok is like a fresh air to the Java Developers. In POJO classes we need to explicitly declare the @getter @settter methods, @toString method, generate @hasCode. We also can apply Lombok in the DTO classes and we can reduce the boilerplate codes for the LOGGER classes.

In this section I'll try to explain every annotations that Lombok offers to us...
